                    <div class="first"><span class="second">I</span> grew up watching <i>The Powerpuff Girls</i>. I remember <i>this</i> villain pretty clearly, though I had to look their name up to find this image.

                    <img src="../img/him.png" class="center">
                        <br>
                    The design, though, stuck with me. For those of you who either didn't watch <i>TPG</i> or also don't remember the name, it's HIM. The villain HIM, described, as per Wikipedia, as "sinister, manipulative, and effeminate." To make a long story short, you'd be surprised how many "HIM"s there are in media: villains who are <i>not quite</i> conforming to gender norms, often without any explanation. This is commonly referred to as <b>queer coding</b>: characters who are, frankly, queer (especially stereotypically) but aren't officially acknowledged as such.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    My <i>first</i> experience with this phenomenon was HIM, but my 'favorite' one is <i>Psycho</i> (1960)'s Norman Bates. It's a classic movie, and Norman has the rare benefit of having his gender 'deviancy' named (albeit denied). <i>Psycho</i> was my doorway into <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i> and <i>Silence of the Lambs</i>, two other classics with their roots in real-life serial killer Ed Gein. This was around the point I realized the staggering amount of queer theming underneath flashy horror titles.
                        <br>

                        <br>
                    So that's <i>in the closet</i>: somewhere to collect all the strange little ties between the LGBTQ+ community, horror, and pop culture. If you've ever gotten lost in Related articles on Wikipedia, I hope this blog scratches the same itch.
